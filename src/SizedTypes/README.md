Coinduction with sized types implementation from [Well-founded recursion with copatterns and sized types](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/39794AEA4D0F5003C8E9F88E564DA8DD/S0956796816000022a.pdf/well-founded-recursion-with-copatterns-and-sized-types.pdf).

Quick explanation about the files here:

- `Size.hs` - Size logic.
- `Stream.hs` - Sized Streams.
- `CoList.hs` - Sized lazy lists.
- `List.hs` - Alternative implementation of sized lazy lists.
- `BF.hs` - Breadth first labeling of infinite trees.
